Fork of [passport-mongo](https://github.com/tutsplus/passport-mongo) by [Tuts+](https://github.com/tutsplus). Here is the [blog](https://www.airpair.com/javascript/complete-expressjs-nodejs-mongodb-crud-skeleton)

I'll add an entity that can be CRUDed by an user following this [tutorial](https://www.airpair.com/javascript/complete-expressjs-nodejs-mongodb-crud-skeleton). And this [repo](https://github.com/kacole2/express-node-mongo-skeleton)

passport-mongo
==============
This repository serves as an example of a basic Node.js application which is using [Passport](http://passportjs.org/) as the authentication middleware for authenticating against a locally configured Mongo backend

Steps to run the app
=====================
* After cloning the repo, install the dependencies by running **npm install**
* To start the server, run **npm start** on the base directory.

Perquisites
============
The server assumes that you have a local mongo instance running. This means if you have mongo installed locally, all you need to do is configure the db.js file correctly and run the mongod daemon
